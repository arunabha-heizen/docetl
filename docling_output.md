## 1. EVENTS

- (a)  Equity  Financing. If  there  is  an  Equity  Financing before the termination of this SAFE, on the initial closing of such Equity Financing, this SAFE will automatically convert into the number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Conversion Price. In connection with the automatic  conversion  of  this  SAFE  into  shares  of  Safe  Preferred  Stock,  the  Investor  will  execute  and deliver to the Company all of the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such  documents  (i)  are  the  same  documents  to  be  entered  into  with  the  purchasers  of  Standard Preferred  Stock,  with  appropriate  variations  for  the  SAFE  Preferred  Stock  if  applicable,  and  (ii)  have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including (without limitation) limited representations, warranties, liability and indemnification obligations for the Investor.
- (b)  Liquidity  Event. If  there  is  a  Liquidity  Event  before  the  termination  of  this  SAFE,  this  SAFE  will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion  of  Proceeds,  due  and  payable  to  the  Investor  immediately  prior  to,  or  concurrent  with,  the consummation of such Liquidity Event, equal to the greater of (i) the Purchase Amount (the " Cash-Out Amount ") or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount  divided by the Liquidity Price (the " Conversion  Amount "). If any of the  Company's securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that the Investor may not choose to receive a  form  of  consideration  that  the  Investor  would  be  ineligible  to  receive  as  a  result  of  the  Investor's failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company's securityholders, or under any applicable laws.
- (c) Dissolution Event. If there is a Dissolution Event before the termination of this SAFE, the Investor will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event.

(d) Liquidation Priority. In  a  Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event, this SAFE is intended to operate like standard non-participating Preferred Stock. The Investor's right to receive its Cash-Out Amount is:

- Junior to payment of outstanding indebtedness and creditor claims, including contractual claims for payment.
- On par with payments for Preferred Stock, and is senior to payments for Common Stock.
- Junior to payments for other SAFEs whose Purchase Amount is greater than or equal to the Purchase Amount.
